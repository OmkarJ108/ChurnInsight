# ChurnInsight
"Python-powered churn prediction boosted customer retention for telecom company."

:I completed a successful project on predicting customer churn in a
telecom company. We used Python to build a smart system that
analyzed customer data using different machine learning techniques.
To make sense of the data, we visualized it with Power BI. The final
model was then integrated into the company's systems using Pickle,
allowing them to make better decisions and retain more customers.
